        <h1 class="hero-heading">Hey!This is my personal experience of travelling to Darjeeling.</h1>
        <p style="font-size:25px;">
            Darjeeling is one of the most beautiful hill stations in Eastern India. It is widely known across the globe
            for its quality tea production. A popular summer retreat for the then Britishers, it is in abundance with
            valleys and tea plantations, and the mesmerising view of the Mt. Kangchenjunga.
        </p>
    
        <p style="font-size:25px;">
            After the journey from the plains, it is tempt­ing to take the motorable road to Darjeel­ing, but we chose
            the slower narrow gauge train. The conversion from steam to diesel engine has added some speed to the
            heritage train but it is still a slow ride, taking about six to seven hours while a road journey takes
            subsequently less sans any traffic jam. But then isn’t a trip to Darjeeling, located in the northern part of
            West Bengal and popularly known as the Queen of Indian hill stations, about lan­guorous pleasures, basking
            beneath the shadow of the Himalayan snow ranges, sipping endless cups of the champagne of teas and riding
            the toy train?
        </p>

        <p style="font-size:25px;">
            We explored very few places due to time constrain but the experince was amazing and worth every penny.The
            places we explored are-A clock tower there,A legacy restaurant, a vintage photo stu­dio, or the botanical
            garden. While newer brands have made inroads, we were happy to note that two old restaurants, Keventers (our
            preferred choice for breakfast, tea and mountain views) and Glenary’s (for lunch), were holding on to their
            fame and position.
